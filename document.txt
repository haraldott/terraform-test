- Monitoring: unfortunately, given the time, I was not able to fully get the monitoring components (alertmanager, prometheus)
to work, so I've commented that out so that terraform apply works. Also, there's no logging implemented yet.
One would have to think about a) where to store the logs b) find a trade of between keeping them long enough / and not keeping them
for too long, so we don't have to use too much space.
- different environments are currently implemented by using prod / dev / staging branches.
One would have to keep configuration for each branch in different folders and keep these folders safe from being overwritten by merges
from dev -> staging -> prod. I've chosen this path, because it works with no extra tooling.
- Would be able to outsource all the single resources into K8s, but would've taken too much time.
